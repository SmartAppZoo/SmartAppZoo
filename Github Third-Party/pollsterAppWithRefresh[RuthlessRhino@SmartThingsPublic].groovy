/**
 *  Pollster - The SmartThings Polling Daemon.
 *
 *  Many SmartThings devices rely on polling to update their status
 *  periodically. Pollster works behind the scenes and calls poll()
 *  function for selected devices so you don't have to rely on SmartThings
 *  built-in polling engine. Devices can be arranged in four groups with
 *  configurable polling intervals. The polling interval can be as short as
 *  one minute.
